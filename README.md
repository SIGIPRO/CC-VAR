# CC-VAR: Cellular Complex Vector Autoregressive Models

This repository contains the official Python implementation of the **CC-VAR** algorithm, as presented in the EUSIPCO 2025 paper:

> **Cellular Autoregressive Higher-Order Models**  
> Abdullah Canbolat, Rohan Money, and Baltasar Beferull-Lozano  
> *European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2025.*  
> [[PDF](https://eusipco2025.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/0002517.pdf)]

CC-VAR extends vector autoregression to **Cellular Complexes**, enabling efficient online learning and forecasting on higher-order networks (nodes, edges, polygons) with reduced computational complexity compared to simplicial approaches.
